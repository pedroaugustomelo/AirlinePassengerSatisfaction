# Airline Passenger Satisfaction
Data Science Project - Analysis from Udacity Nano Degree Project I


## Motivation

In this project we are going to analize how data can be useful in predicting airline customer's satisfaction. 

## Process 

We used the CRISP-DM(Cross-Industry Process For Data Mining) methodology, following the steps bellow:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Business Understanding 

One of the greatest inventions of mankind was the airplane, since it turned travels significantly faster, more pratical and more comfortable. Nowadays, this kind of transportation is carried out by hundreds of airlines across the world and widely adopted by the costumers, especially in long trips. In order to analyze the satisfation of costumers related to the service provided by the airlines, we intend to answer three questions:

1. Which class (Business, Echo or Echo Plus) was the most satisfied based on rating?
2. What is the distribution of marketshare across Classes according to age?
3. How well can we predict customer's satisfaction (Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifier)?

## Installation

Libraries required: 

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

The dataset is available in this Repository under the csv file.

## File Description

The ipynb file describes the CRIP-DM approach and the CVS file the dataset used.
